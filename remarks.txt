IOCCC Entry
-----------

My entry takes in two integers from stdin, like ./prog 15 5
It then RETURNS the value of the greatest common denominator of the two integers.

It's obfuscated with some simple #define statements and also a multitude of variations of different combinations of "l" and "1" for variable names, function names, etc.
It's not terribly complex but it was my first time trying anything like this, so I had fun.
Thanks for reading!
